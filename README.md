## About me
I am pursuing a Master's degree in Tourism Studies at Hokkaido University.   
**My research keywords: Rural Revitalization, Creative Tourism, Female In-migrant Entrepreneurs.**  

I am from Hainan Island, an island in Hainan Province, China. My research location is also an island—Naoshima, Japan. I hope that the results of my two-year Master's study can contribute to my hometown.
