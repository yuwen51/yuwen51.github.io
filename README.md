## About me
#### **Hi, I'm Wenyu Wang（王雯钰）**  
welcome to my website!  

I am pursuing a Master's degree in Tourism Studies at Hokkaido University.   
**My research keywords: Rural Revitalization, Creative Tourism, Female In-migrant Entrepreneurs.**  

I am from Hainan Island, an island in Hainan Province, China. My research location is also an island—Naoshima, Japan. I hope that the results of my two-year Master's study can contribute to my hometown.

In my spare time, I enjoy playing badminton, traveling, attending concerts, and exploring the unknown. So far, I have visited several cities in China, including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Sichuan, Chongqing, Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi. I also enjoy watching variety shows, and if given the opportunity, I would love to try working behind the scenes on these shows. I have also been to various cities in Japan, such as Tokyo, Osaka, Hiroshima, Kagawa, Okayama, and Ibaraki. I once spent a week at Donglin Temple（廬山東林寺）near Mount Lu for Zen meditation, immersing myself in Buddhist culture (though currently I am agnostic).
